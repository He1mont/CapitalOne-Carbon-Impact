## Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of web development and HTTP requests.
- A development environment set up with tools like cURL or a programming language like Python or JavaScript.

## Step 2: Understanding the Capital One API

Capital One provides access to customer data via their Account Information Service (AIS) data endpoints. You can retrieve information about accounts, balances, and transactions.

Here are some key points to understand:

- **Access Methods**: You'll use OAuth2 Authorization Code to authenticate and access the API.

- **Endpoint URLs**:
    - Accounts: `https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts`
    - Balances: `https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/balances`
    - Transactions: `https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/transactions`

## Step 3: Account Information

Let's start by accessing account information.

**Retrieve Accounts**

Use the following endpoint to fetch account data:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'
```

**Retrieve a Specific Account**

To retrieve information about a specific account, use the following endpoint:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/$AccountId" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'
```

## Step 4: Balances

Now, let's access balance information.

**Retrieve Balances**

To get balance information for all accounts, use this endpoint:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/balances" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'
```

**Retrieve Balance for a Specific Account**

To retrieve the balance for a specific account, use this endpoint:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/$accountId/balances" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'
```

## Step 5: Transactions

Finally, let's access transaction data.

**Retrieve Transactions**

To get transaction data for all accounts, use this endpoint:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/transactions?fromBookingDateTime=$fromBookingDate&toBookingDateTime=$toBookingDate" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'
```

**Retrieve Transactions for a Specific Account**

To retrieve transaction data for a specific account, use this endpoint:

```bash
$ curl -X GET "https://open-banking.capitalone.co.uk/open-banking/v3.1/aisp/accounts/$accountId/transactions?fromBookingDateTime=$fromBookingDate&toBookingDateTime=$toBookingDate" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer $accessToken'
```

## Step 6: Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

Keep in mind that after customer authentication, you can access more than 90 days of transaction data for a short period (up to 5 minutes). For data older than 90 days, you must request it following a successful customer authentication journey.
