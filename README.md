## Prototype

This is the introduction of our project.

[Egg.js](https://www.eggjs.org) is adopted for backend and [React]((https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) is adopted for [frontend](./frontend/).

### Backend

In [backend](./backend/) directory, the project could be started by running the following command:

```shell
cd backend/
npm install
npm run dev
```

After starting the server, access it via http://localhost:7001/.

The currently implemented APIs are detailed in the [router configuration file](./backend/app/router.js).

### Frontend

In [frontend](./frontend/) directory, the project could be started by running the following command:

```shell
cd frontend/
npm install
npm start
```

The website would be available at http://localhost:3000.

The frontend has been thoroughly tested, and all tests have successfully passed. To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
npm test /src/tests
```
