# OpenAI

## QuickStart

The openAI API calls the openAI API in and generates response the users prompts. The responses are tailored and summarised before displayed to users.

The ChatGPT of our project can be launched using the following command

```shell
cd openAI/
npm i
node index.js
```

Then the help page is able to handle requests sent to the openAI API.
